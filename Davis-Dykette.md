## Highlights
The struggle of the dykette for Sasha was that she wanted more than anything to be noticed. Recognized. Not even as gay, really—just as pretty. Or as literally anything. But it was also her biggest fear, being scrutinized. Attention was the mechanism through which she would be exposed. — location: [2062](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09Y461FHN&location=2062) ^ref-3764
