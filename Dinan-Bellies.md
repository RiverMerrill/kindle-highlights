## Highlights
I’d never wanted to give this much time to someone, and I was as anxious when I was apart from him as I was happy when I was with him. — location: [290](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BJF9F3GQ&location=290) ^ref-39757

He said his heart is much better when he’s around me. He needs me. And then I wondered why I wanted so much reassurance, anyway, why I’d let myself arrive at a place where I was so uneasy, why I couldn’t just be happy that he transmuted me into a more tolerable version of myself. — location: [1011](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BJF9F3GQ&location=1011) ^ref-49562

Sometimes a person, an achievement or a place—whatever is missing—seems the perfect shape to fill a void, so much so that its absence seems to be the cause of the problem and its presence the solution. But up close, the voids are always much larger. — location: [1330](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BJF9F3GQ&location=1330) ^ref-17375

It’s funny how scared I used to be about my heart stopping, and how careless I’ve become once presented with an actual risk of it. — location: [2873](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BJF9F3GQ&location=2873) ^ref-32368

It’s important to remember, Tom, that accepting responsibility doesn’t mean accepting blame, and that you can take charge of your own life without it being an admission of guilt or fault. — location: [3191](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BJF9F3GQ&location=3191) ^ref-22841

On my way back there’s a man leaning against a railing outside a building. He says hello to me. I look down and pick up my pace. He laughs. I never know if they know, but I don’t think it matters. Those looks come from a place of either hate or lust, and I’ve learned that those things often aren’t far apart. — location: [4201](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BJF9F3GQ&location=4201) ^ref-43396

We walk in silence. I know if we talk too much it’ll feel like we’re simulating our old life together. — location: [4375](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BJF9F3GQ&location=4375) ^ref-30490
