I’m afraid, I said slowly, the words stilted and ungainly as they left my throat, that I’m not very well constructed to . . . be with anyone. For me there was only Amit and that was a disaster. Friendship I can navigate, though there are still things there that feel like too much. I can like, pull, you know, get someone home. Sometimes after I sleep with someone all I feel is contempt; sometimes I feel that contempt while things are happening, like I hate the person, like I’m thinking like sexist things, like the words dumb bitch will be flashing in my mind while I’m doing shit to someone. I feel like being a little cruel makes me better at sex with women, something about wanting to bring a person to their knees. But then it’s over and I can’t bear the sight of them. I’m afraid maybe of being with someone I also really like, because then what if I’m ugly to that someone, like—I don’t know. — location: [1088](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09KXQ684T&location=1088) ^ref-57362

But nobody consoles you after a rupture with a beloved friend. There are few movies ideal for watching while your tears salt pints of ice cream, no articles in women’s magazines that you can skim at the hairdresser’s. You have only the ache. No script to accompany it. No ritual to give it shape. — location: [2257](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09KXQ684T&location=2257) ^ref-51023

good love can rescue a person. Pull them out of the waves. Bad love is a rip current. It can drown you. — location: [3805](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09KXQ684T&location=3805) ^ref-4489

Romantic love is an instrument of capitalist domination. It gives people false hopes of self-actualization, ensures class division through wealth inheritance, and misdirects energy away from improving working people’s material conditions. Basically love exists to market expensive fitness classes to straight people. — location: [3925](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09KXQ684T&location=3925) ^ref-4055

We create our lives saying one small yes to one small thing at a time. We create the world that way. — location: [4228](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09KXQ684T&location=4228) ^ref-48887
