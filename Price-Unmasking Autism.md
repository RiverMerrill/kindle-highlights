## Highlights
“Now I know I’m Autistic, but I kinda found out about it too late,” she says. “If I tell people, they don’t want to believe me. I have my life together too much for them to realize how hard it all is. Nobody wants to hear now about how hard it’s always been, always still is, frankly.” — location: [298](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B098PXH8CK&location=298) ^ref-24356

Autistic people are at a high risk of violence, as well as negative mental health outcomes. Since we can’t openly stim or engage in other repetitive behaviors, some masked Autistic people reach for flawed coping strategies to help manage stress. We’re at an elevated risk of eating disorders,[32] alcoholism and drug addiction,[33] and insecure attachments to others.[34] We tend to maintain shallow relationships, out of fear that people would hate getting to know our “real selves.” We may withdraw from other people, leading to negative emotional and psychological outcomes. And the more isolated we are, the less practice we get socializing, leading to a feedback loop of social disempowerment and shame. — location: [507](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B098PXH8CK&location=507) ^ref-56995
