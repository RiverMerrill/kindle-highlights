## Highlights
Because that was the whole point, really, wasn’t it? She was heartbroken, yes. She kept thinking about the lost future with Mei, about the fact that she would never kiss her again, would never sit across the sofa from her and hear about the plan for the latest sculpture. Would never again walk into a restaurant proud that of everyone in the world Mei could be at dinner with, she had chosen to be with Bette. But all of it was amplified by the mortification, by the humiliation. The shame of having shouted so loudly about being so in love, and to have been proved incorrect. Of having been found inadequate. Far too easy to let go of and move on from. Inconsequential. — location: [3289](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CH9K36HT&location=3289) ^ref-14541

I’m really sad about all the things I thought we’d have that we won’t now. I’m so sad that it fell apart because we both assumed stuff that wasn’t true. I want to stop being sad about it, but it’s still there.” — location: [4475](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CH9K36HT&location=4475) ^ref-46061

“Everyone always getting over someone. People die. People leave. Everyone is sad, but don’t just be sad. Might as well love too.” — location: [4493](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CH9K36HT&location=4493) ^ref-41655

“You’re really good, I think, at performing happiness. At convincing yourself—at convincing everyone—that things are exactly as you want them. It’s what I was worried about when you were with Mei. You were always in a state before she came round, making the flat perfect or stressing out in the kitchen, and we both know you hate cooking. You shuffled your life around her, making sure you were free when she might want you over. You were always on edge. But as soon as she was there in front of you, you were happy as anything. Everything was perfect. Even if it wasn’t.” — location: [4715](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CH9K36HT&location=4715) ^ref-13116
