## Highlights
A clear thing Wendy did remember from boy life: She’d been a terrible liar. Maybe there is something to trans women being deceivers, she thought. — location: [373](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DMP5FTP&location=373) ^ref-32861

And often, later in the day, she would remember, Oh, right, I wasn’t going to drink today. But by then, the notion seemed silly. Like, right, that was a thing she’d planned—but was it truly necessary? Wendy liked that feeling of giving in. It felt gentle and soft and sleepy and weak. Like within was rest. She knew that wasn’t good, but when she tried to hold it all in her head and really think about it, it would evaporate. It would slip out of sight like something pulled from a cat’s paws. — location: [840](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DMP5FTP&location=840) ^ref-2831

“People need your love the most when they deserve it the least.” — location: [1273](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DMP5FTP&location=1273) ^ref-36832

She had a fatalism about this stuff—guys, dating—she had to fight. She fell too easily into fatalism, period. (There was a reason she avoided the Internet as much as she did.) How could men ever love her? She would never be loved, and now she thought, No. She thought, Do it right. She even set a reminder in her phone. 12:30 p.m.: Ernie. Do it right, love. — location: [1376](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DMP5FTP&location=1376) ^ref-15404

‘I refuse to call myself anything but a transsexual. I earned all those syllables.’” — location: [2317](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DMP5FTP&location=2317) ^ref-23516

---
an awful creep or is paying for the privilege and sometimes both. More and more, I feel like life is something that’s just happening to me. My choices don’t feel like choices at all. It’s like they’re things that have been decided and I just react to them the way anybody would. — location: [2938](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DMP5FTP&location=2938) ^ref-9190

Here, here is my skin that feels like your skin, my muscles and frailties that feel like yours, the lift of your flesh something I intuitively know from my own body, inner maps that, for most of my life, I thought were purely shameful and mine alone. And here, with you, with me, for minutes, for hours, if nothing else—a line from a book Wendy couldn’t remember appeared to her in a slippery ripple of memory—If I loved you, this is how I would love you. — location: [3730](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DMP5FTP&location=3730) ^ref-3680

For years now, sex kept changing on her. Her own desire felt milky, like silt, something in a river, something she could see until she tried to hold it and make it function, and it ran through her fingers into nothing. — location: [4417](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DMP5FTP&location=4417) ^ref-55972

Sophie’s life had included an infinite whiplash of much bigger changes than Wendy’d ever dealt with. Sophie had moved heaven and earth to improve her life many times—and she was dead. — location: [4443](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DMP5FTP&location=4443) ^ref-7122

“No one makes a New Year’s Resolution to see more prostitutes.” Fucking—Sophie— — location: [4485](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DMP5FTP&location=4485) ^ref-36099

---
But she wished she hadn’t bought the king cans. The mickey from yesterday being long gone. Her love, her real true love, was cold hard alcohol mixed with something light, like diet pop or water. There was nothing else that felt so clean in her body. — location: [4604](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DMP5FTP&location=4604) ^ref-18546
