Before I began to mortgage my liver and lungs, before I had friends afraid of cops and sidewalks, before I had dead friends, I just wanted to know what it was like to walk around with another girl and do that. I want to know what it’s like to not be deathly worried about your friends. I’m so very tired of this. I can’t stand it. — location: [2743](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BVWLKX2L&location=2743) ^ref-494

I just never really learned how you get back to normal. And even if I did. Even if I did pass all of the time, even if I could move somewhere no one knew me, even if I could get back to normal, it’s just. I mean. These are still my friends. It exhausts me, it slows me down, it balls me up on the couch with movies and terrible food and it makes me weak. It’s not beautiful or brave or redemptive. It’s like a light case of mono that never goes away. I don’t want to be brave. I want us to be okay. — location: [2760](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BVWLKX2L&location=2760) ^ref-46279

Let me go with my luck. She’s what I’ll dream of. Lying on the floor, a sunny sky coming in through the window, under the pure of her eyes and the turn of her hair, giving myself to her brush, forever, without wish to go forward or leave. — location: [3459](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BVWLKX2L&location=3459) ^ref-54134
