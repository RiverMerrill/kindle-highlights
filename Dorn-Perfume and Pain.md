## Highlights
A psychologist might say my taste for doggystyle, which avoids eye contact, suggests a fear of intimacy, but luckily I never really told my therapist the truth. — location: [162](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CL5G99HC&location=162) ^ref-57699

I had sex constantly on the Patricia Highsmith, but I never really remembered it. I was apparently very sexual on it, which puzzled me, because sober I hardly ever think about sex, only about being adored. — location: [284](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CL5G99HC&location=284) ^ref-3282

---
It’s not that I hate my family or anything. I just feel very uncomfortable around them and harbor the vague suspicion that they hate me, which isn’t entirely unfounded given that while they’ve been supportive in a material and financial sense, they mostly seem to find my personality, affect, choices, and demeanor to be unpleasant at best. — location: [383](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CL5G99HC&location=383) ^ref-40452

In the morning, I realize my dream is about lesbian bed death. I’ve experienced it many times, that thing when your girlfriend becomes more like a best friend and then more like a sister. And you love your sister, but you don’t want to fuck her. — location: [401](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CL5G99HC&location=401) ^ref-20692

My feelings have always been a mystery. Thoughts are much easier, more fun. — location: [1158](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CL5G99HC&location=1158) ^ref-34675

I wonder if I need to be doing exercise other than stomping angrily up a hill. — location: [1715](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CL5G99HC&location=1715) ^ref-56620

But the line between having sex by choice and against one’s will, I’ve always thought, is impossibly thin. Especially when you’re a petite lush, when you’re a drunk and impossibly thin yourself. — location: [1761](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CL5G99HC&location=1761) ^ref-25138

---
Sometimes I can’t tell if I love someone or if I just want to up the stakes of the relationship or if there is a difference. — location: [1796](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CL5G99HC&location=1796) ^ref-41814

I prefer not to hug someone unless I am fucking them. — location: [1813](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CL5G99HC&location=1813) ^ref-2370

Yeah, I reply. Then, to appease her, I write: I wish Penelope wasn’t here. Me too, Ivy says. Ivy became a little aggressive when I told her I was going to the concert with Penelope, an aggression that felt so familiar—of past girlfriends and recent Ivy—that it almost felt safe. I wish it was you instead, I write back. But I’m not sure I mean it. Ivy responds with seven pink heart emojis. — location: [2095](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CL5G99HC&location=2095) ^ref-48044
