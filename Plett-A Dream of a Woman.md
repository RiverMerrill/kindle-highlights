## Highlights
If your early thirties can be a rebirth, after rebirth had, supposedly, already been part of your life (I bought into the transition-as-second-puberty stuff hard), then any period of your life can bring renewal. Can’t it? I believe in that. — location: [335](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09F3XCSK1&location=335) ^ref-43359

It was a Pacific Northwest no-bugs-no-humidity-PBR-and-two-buck-Chuck summer, and it felt to David like a life. — location: [387](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09F3XCSK1&location=387) ^ref-10289

“Think on it.” She could just fluidly chart out forward motion like this. Life paths were open things, and Iris picked and sampled and offered them at her choosing. “I have a room out there starting November 1. I was gonna go in October and look for a job.” And I could disappear, thought David. — location: [1034](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09F3XCSK1&location=1034) ^ref-19295

You’re not cis. You’ll never be cis. You’ll be trans ’til it kills you. You’ll fight, and you’ll shag, and you’ll hate yourself ’til it makes you quiver, but you’ll never be cis. Transgenderism isn’t brains, children, it’s blood! Blood screaming inside you to work its will! — location: [1062](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09F3XCSK1&location=1062) ^ref-15232

This was where the architect had probably been truly right: Some people were never happy. Moving to a different city did not solve your fucking problems! — location: [1252](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09F3XCSK1&location=1252) ^ref-63918

When they fell silent for the first time in hours, Iris closed her eyes and leaned forward, and when they kissed and brought their arms together, every old crackling sensation of Iris’s body collided with every beautiful virgin feeling of David liking her own. — location: [1463](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09F3XCSK1&location=1463) ^ref-6787

David stretched her body beneath her lover, wrapped her hands around the bed frame, felt the cool of the sheets on her skin. Oh—it was then she realized—this is what it’s actually like to be touched. — location: [1472](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09F3XCSK1&location=1472) ^ref-11004

(“You are my son,” Connie’d said resignedly last phone call. “You can do whatever you want, that’s fine. You’ll lead your life and it’s yours. You get to do that. But I gave birth to you. You’re my son. And there is nothing that anyone can do to make that change.”). — location: [1644](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09F3XCSK1&location=1644) ^ref-61003

We stared at each other awkwardly. It’s age-old. You meet someone whose mould of pariah weirdo looks something like yours, and you try to reach out, but you’re on guard, because what if you hate each other, or what if she sucks—plus, what if somebody clocks the two of you together when on your own you would’ve gone undetected? — location: [1945](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09F3XCSK1&location=1945) ^ref-36456

All these strangers, they have lives and they’re going on without you and what you can do is nothing, nothing, nothing but walk alone and sit in your room. Supposedly, one day, life will be different, but how does that mean anything and how can you believe that? The strangers say they’re feeling the same way. I know I should believe they are. — location: [2088](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09F3XCSK1&location=2088) ^ref-18189

“After a certain age, bio family is chosen family, too. You choose to keep it up—or you don’t. Both kinds can be unhealthy. Both kinds can be good. And you’re never obligated to do a thing to someone who isn’t good to you. Ever. It gets to be on your terms, I promise, Vera. You get to set terms, too, now.” — location: [2153](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09F3XCSK1&location=2153) ^ref-42879

“You don’t have to believe I’m a woman. But if you want to keep a relationship with me, you’ll need to pretend that you do.” — location: [2174](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09F3XCSK1&location=2174) ^ref-60345

Vera realized her selfhood was sutured with these women from her life, that the only lie about the old him dying was that the skin of the person she’d stepped into wasn’t a cis lady she’d conjured from the air but a blanket fashioned from a kaleidoscope of them, shards and spackles that lived in her like bacteria, like DNA, joyous and ailing, a double helix of protection and illness. — location: [2207](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09F3XCSK1&location=2207) ^ref-24853

Ava unzips her skirt and Gemma lowers her body onto the carpet. Gemma sucks her and Ava takes Gemma’s hair in her hands and undoes her pigtail buns and Gemma’s brown hair falls down her back. She hears Ava take something from her nightstand. And then she feels something on her head. It’s a brush. Ava brushes Gemma’s hair as Gemma sucks Ava on her knees. “Good,” Ava says quietly, her free hand resting on Gemma’s head. “Good, good, good.” — location: [2407](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09F3XCSK1&location=2407) ^ref-7799

Sure, Gemma feels more energetic when she’s sober, more attuned to life, but that’s not a plus. Drinking, for her, turns violent despair into garden-variety sadness. If it works that way, she’ll take it. — location: [2847](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09F3XCSK1&location=2847) ^ref-3211

“The temptation to remove oneself from the world does not lack for appeal,” she says. “The idea does not need a Scriptural mandate to accrue power. Anybody who doesn’t feel accepted within the world—which is most people, regardless of whether it’s actually true—can be excited by this desire.” — location: [3073](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09F3XCSK1&location=3073) ^ref-5129

Blackouts are gun-toting enemies fused to one’s back, pale, disinterested monsters impassive to the ruin of ricochet. Can they ever surprise with unintentional kindness? Make sufficient the evil of the day? A gift untraceable to either heaven or hell, a glowing orb that can’t be trusted, but neither can it be refused? Gemma feels like maybe she can trust these two. She’ll find out if that’s the case. She’ll figure it out. She is a woman about to attempt to be alive for the millionth fucking time. Gemma presses her nose to the window while Olive blinks in and out of sleep while Ava and Holly laugh at a workstation while a pocket universe unspools. Gemma had that only partway right. It begins as a universe as hopeful and possible as any other. It will quietly weave its own fence posts, it will discover its rhythm and order. — location: [3359](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09F3XCSK1&location=3359) ^ref-44122
