## Highlights
Then, when she had been working there a year or two, she had this kind of intense and scary realization that for a really long time—as boring and clichéd as this is—for as long as she could remember, she had felt all fucked up. — location: [85](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=85) ^ref-53151

---
It’s a familiar sense of removal that has bothered the hell out of every partner she’s ever had. I’m sorry, she always thinks, I learned to police myself pretty fiercely when I was a tiny little baby, internalizing social norms and trying to keep myself safe from them at the same time. I’m pretty astute with the keeping myself safe. — location: [137](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=137) ^ref-47802

---
All she knew about trans people was all anybody knows about trans people before they start looking: that they are all psychos with big hair who trick straight men into having sex with them. — location: [219](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=219) ^ref-25854

Kerouac — location: [232](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=232) ^ref-53484

---
Taking drugs on a farm actually still probably wouldn’t feel all that weird to her now, even though she grew tits, but that’s just because she carries all that around with her. Who doesn’t? All the music we listen to is about carrying the past around with us. — location: [235](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=235) ^ref-30094

---
Six years on and it’s still weird to be called Miss. Not bad, just like, oh yeah, I guess I did that. Who knows whether that part of being trans ever fades. Probably not. Or more specifically, probably not when you still have to shave, when your junk still gets in the way and makes your clothes fit wrong every morning. It probably doesn’t go away until you are rich. — location: [247](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=247) ^ref-36170

---
My eyes are glaring cunts, he pretty much yells. My cunt a furious eye. — location: [275](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=275) ^ref-49602

---
Maria is transsexual and she is so meek she might disappear. — location: [307](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=307) ^ref-60425

---
He is trans too. He’s pretty into it: for Maria, being trans is like, here is this shitty thing I have to deal with, but for Kieran it’s like, fuck yeah! Being trans, all right! Trans guys seem to have this relationship to being trans a lot more often than trans women. — location: [353](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=353) ^ref-22415

---
She’s thinking, I think I just don’t get sex, while she shoulders her bike and starts climbing stairs. Maybe one day, when my seven hundred dollars of savings becomes twenty thousand and I can afford bottom surgery, I’ll be able to get past the inevitable shutoff point and actually enjoy it. Can’t wait. — location: [379](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=379) ^ref-2970

---
if you could leave civilization for a year, like live in an abandoned shopping mall out in the desert giving yourself injections of estrogen, working on your voice, figuring out how to dress yourself all over again and meditating eight hours a day on gendered socialization, and then get bottom surgery as a reward, it would be pretty easy to transition. — location: [585](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=585) ^ref-16050

---
Look at all these girls, they know how to dress themselves, they know how to stand, they know when to talk and when to be quiet. Maria felt like she didn’t. — location: [708](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=708) ^ref-64702

---
I’m posting an ad on Craigslist for people to date who also have chlamydia, Maria says. — location: [799](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=799) ^ref-47162

---
She painted her nails sometimes though, this otherwise normal bro, with like, shaggy hair and coral nails. People would actually ask what was wrong with her, too. Why would you do that, they’d ask, and then she’d try to imply that it was because she liked rock ’n’ roll or something. — location: [915](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=915) ^ref-63558

---
It’s so easy just to check out and leave your body. This is like an abuse thing, isn’t it? Abuse survivors dissociate like this? As far as Maria knows she was never abused, but maybe repressing and policing yourself so hard for so long before transitioning can look like abuse, function like abuse. — location: [993](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=993) ^ref-65326

---
I’m just at this point where I’m stomping around like I know everything about everything, just because I transitioned and now creepy old men on the street hit on me—when really, I’m stunted back at like age thirteen, age five, age zero, when I first started suppressing stuff I knew I couldn’t say in public. — location: [1196](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=1196) ^ref-62437

---
I’m just like, I need to be single for a while! So badly! I haven’t been single and transitioned at the same time ever in my whole life, and how am I supposed to have un-fucked-up relationships with people if I’ve never done that? So I am excited about that. On my bike on the way over today I felt like I was flying. My lungs are all full, I feel like I can breathe—all the end of the Lifetime movie things. — location: [1201](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=1201) ^ref-27216

---
When she was little, she was responsible for protecting everybody else from her own shit around her gender—responsible for making sure her parents didn’t have to have a weird kid. Of course, then they had a weird, sad kid anyway, right? Whatever. — location: [1327](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=1327) ^ref-32591

---
It’s clear that being responsible has not been a positive force in her life. It has been fucking everything up. — location: [1335](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=1335) ^ref-18456

---
Then, you figure out that when you first started spending more time with women in a nonsexual way, they weren’t treating you like a boy, and they were letting you in kind of similarly to how they normally let other women in, but you were this effusive, messy, uncertain person of indeterminate gender who was prone to freaking out and having breakdowns over things like, say, boys giving flowers to your friends but not to you. — location: [1357](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=1357) ^ref-10572

---
disclosing that she’s gay always feels like it’s necessarily going to lead to the person figuring out that she’s trans, and not only does that feel scary and kind of dangerous, but it feels like they also might want to ask whether she’s really gay, if someone who is Really A Man and dates women isn’t just some fuckin creepy dude. — location: [1402](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=1402) ^ref-60689

---
But it turns out that using your partner basically as a sex toy to get yourself off—suspending disbelief and convincing yourself that she’s hot for you, that she’s into it—is even lonelier than never getting off. — location: [1632](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=1632) ^ref-64422

---
This is the fourth relationship in a row where she’s looked up and realized that she’s been lying and faking for three months, nine months, two and a half years. — location: [1647](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=1647) ^ref-4296

---
Since nobody really wants to be a trans woman, i.e., nobody wakes up and goes whoa, maybe my life would be better if I transitioned, alienating most of my friends and my family, I wonder what’ll happen at work, I’d love to spend all my money on hormones and surgeries, buy a new wardrobe that I don’t even understand right now, probably become unlovable and then end my short life in a bloody murder. — location: [2537](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=2537) ^ref-55153

---
Maybe convincing yourself that you could never transition is a defense mechanism that enabled you to survive high school, family, work—but like most defense mechanisms, it wasn’t conscious, and like most defense mechanisms, it became a pattern you weren’t aware of, and then, like most defense mechanisms, at some point it stopped making your life easier and started making your life harder. — location: [2546](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=2546) ^ref-47711

---
Deciding to will it away is a defense mechanism that is inevitably going to fail and you’ll be back where you started: trans. Just older and more entrenched in a life that itself is not much more than a coping mechanism designed to keep you from having to be trans in the real world. — location: [2554](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=2554) ^ref-51267

---
When you’ve learned to dissociate defensively around cis people, and you spend all of your time among them, and when they frequently make it clear that you are right not to feel safe around them, you can forget that it is even possible to let your guard down. That you don’t necessarily have to be alone to feel safe. That it is even possible to feel safe. — location: [3224](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=3224) ^ref-47803

---
someone who is “critical” of “the transgender movement” or whatever, ask them what they think trans people should do. If the only thing they can come up with is “not be trans,” point out that the vast majority of trans people have already tried that, and it tends to make us suicidal. If they can’t come up with anything better than “don’t be trans,” please understand that they very literally want me and at least 1.4 million other Americans—not to mention way, way more people outside the U.S.—to die. Don’t let them equivocate. “What should trans people do?” All they’ve got is “die.” It’s kind of intense. — location: [3231](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09DBF2ZZS&location=3231) ^ref-9636
